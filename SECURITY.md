## Reporting a Vulnerability

As this is an **Autonomous Prison System**, security is paramount.

If you discover a security vulnerability (e.g., potential for prison break, unauthorized access, sensor spoofing), please **DO NOT** open a public issue.

Instead, please report it via private channels or email the maintainer directly.
We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeframe for the fix.
