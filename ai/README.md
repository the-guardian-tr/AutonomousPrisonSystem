## 📌 Overview
The **AI Module** is the intelligence core of the **Autonomous Prison System**. It utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms for behavioral analysis, risk prediction, and anomaly detection.

## 🤖 Capabilities
- **Behavioral Analysis:** Monitoring inmate patterns for rehabilitation optimization.
- **Risk Assessment:** Real-time threat detection using computer vision.
- **Predictive Policing:** Anticipating incidents before they occur.

## 🏗 Roadmap
- [ ] Integrate Computer Vision models.
- [ ] Develop Anomaly Detection service.
- [ ] Connect with Backend API.
